# Java-Project
The "Campus Course Manager" is a console-based application developed in Java. 
It serves as a foundational Course Management System designed to streamline the administrative tasks of an educational institution. 
The system allows for the management of two core entities: Students and Courses. 
It provides functionalities to add, view, and manage these entities through an intuitive menu-driven interface.
This project demonstrates the practical application of core Java concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures (ArrayList), and basic input/output operations.
